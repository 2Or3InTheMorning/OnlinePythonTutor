# Wishlist for Python Tutor

This is a wishlist for new Python Tutor features, created by aggregating nearly a decade's worth of user survey responses, GitHub issues, other user feedback, and my own personal notes. Most items here will likely **never get implemented** due to my limited time and energy to devote to this project; I also don't have time to coordinate third-party contributions.

This doc was originally created on 2019-10-20.

First read the [unsupported features doc](unsupported-features.md#read-this-first) to get a sense of what desired features are *not* listed here since they don't fit within Python Tutor's design philosophy.
