Visual regression testing for OPT frontend
started exploring on 2018-06-09 using Google Puppeteer (https://pptr.dev/)

{

  for a really old prior attempt at frontend visual regression testing
  using phantomjs (created around 2013-11-23), see:
  ../../../v3/tests/frontend-tests/opt-screenshot-test.js

  and for a less old version using casperjs, see ../

}

Instructions:

install using:

  npm install puppeteer
  npm install pixelmatch

  (which will install stuff in ../node_modules)
